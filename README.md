# Basic Chatbot

This Java program implements a basic chatbot that interacts with users, providing responses based on predefined messages and allowing users to add new responses during runtime.

## Description

The chatbot prompts users with a greeting message and awaits input from the user. It responds to user messages using a predefined set of responses stored in a file. If the user's message is not recognized, the chatbot prompts the user to provide a response, which it will then remember for future use.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Enter a message when prompted by the chatbot.
3. The chatbot will respond with a pre-defined message if it recognizes the input.
4. If the input is not recognized, the chatbot will prompt you to provide a response, which it will then remember for future use.
5. To exit the chatbot, type 'exit'.
